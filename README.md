# Hash Table with Custom Probing

A custom hash table implementation in C++ using split-sequence linear probing. This project demonstrates manual memory management, dynamic data handling, and performance measurement.

- Implemented dynamic insertion, deletion, and search operations with a custom probing strategy for efficient collision handling.
- Managed memory manually, including dynamic allocation and proper deletion of records to prevent memory leaks and ensure safe usage.
- Calculated and reported performance metrics, such as average successful/unsuccessful access times and fill ratio, for various table sizes.
- Enabled flexible data input from files and user input, with robust error handling for invalid operations.
